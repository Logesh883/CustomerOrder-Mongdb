# mongodb-CRUD-Operations

This README provides an overview and explanation of the code snippet you provided. It demonstrates a basic web application example that implements CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using MongoDB as the database. 

## Prerequisites
Before running the code, make sure you have the following installed:

- MongoDB: A NoSQL database system
- A web server or framework capable of handling HTTP requests (e.g., Express.js for Node.js)

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository or set up a project with the provided code.

2. Install the necessary dependencies. For example, if you are using Node.js and npm, navigate to the project directory and run the following command:

```shell
npm install
```

3. Set up a connection to your MongoDB database. This can be done by configuring the connection details in a separate file or directly in the code. Ensure you have the necessary credentials (e.g., host, port, username, password) to connect to your MongoDB instance.

4. Modify the code as needed to match your database connection settings. Look for sections of code that handle the MongoDB connection and update them accordingly.

5. Start the web server. Depending on your setup, you might run a command like:

```shell
npm start
```

Ensure the server starts without any errors.

6. Access the application in your web browser by navigating to the appropriate URL (e.g., `http://localhost:8000`).

## Explanation

The provided code is written in HTML and uses a templating language to dynamically generate the web page content. Here's an explanation of the different parts:

### HTML Structure

The code begins with the standard HTML structure. It defines the document type, the HTML language, and includes the necessary metadata in the `<head>` section. 

The `<body>` section contains the main content of the page.

### Page Title and Heading

The `<h1>` element displays the title of the page, which is "Mongodb CRUD Example".

### Create Operation

The code checks if the `edit_id` variable is present. If it is, the page displays an edit form. Otherwise, it displays a create form.

#### Edit Form

If the `edit_id` variable is present, the code displays an edit form. The form's `action` attribute specifies the endpoint to handle the form submission for updating a book with the given `edit_id`.

The form contains two input fields: `customerid`, `productid`,`amount`,`address`. The values of these input fields are pre-populated with the existing book's title and author (`customerid`, `productid`,`amount`,`address` respectively).

#### Create Form

If the `edit_id` variable is not present, the code displays a create form. The form's `action` attribute specifies the endpoint to handle the form submission for creating a new book.

The form also contains two input fields: `customerid`, `productid`,`amount`,`address` .

### Book List

The code uses a loop (`{{#each custorder}}`) to iterate over a list of books.

For each book, it generates an 'table' element containing the book's title and author. It also includes two links: "Edit" and "Delete". The "Edit" link includes the book's `_id` as a query parameter (`edit_id={{this._id}}`) to identify which book to edit. The "Delete" link includes the book's `_id` as a query parameter (`delete_id={{this._id}}`). It also includes an `onclick` event to show a confirmation dialog before deleting the book.

### Templating Syntax

The code uses a templating language (not specified in the code snippet) to insert dynamic values into the HTML. The placeholders (`{{message}}`, `{{#if edit_id}}`, `

{{edit_id}}`, `{{edit_book.customerid}}`, `{{edit_book.productid}}`,`{{edit_book.amount}}`,`{{edit_book.price}}`, `{{#each books}}`, `{{this.customerid}}`, `{{this.orderid}}`, `{{this.amount}}`, `{{this.price}}`) are replaced with actual values when the page is rendered.

## Conclusion

This code snippet demonstrates a basic web application that allows users to perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on a collection of books stored in a MongoDB database. It provides forms for creating new books and editing existing ones, as well as displaying a list of books with options to edit or delete each book.
